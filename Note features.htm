						<h4>
						Security features
						</h4>
						<p>
						The main security features of the current banknotes are listed below:
						</p>
						<ul type="disc">
							<li>
							Watermark - White side panel of notes has Mahatma Gandhi watermark.
							<li>
							Security thread - All notes have a silver security band with inscriptions visible when held against light which reads Bharat in Hindi and RBI in English.
							<li>
							Latent image - On notes with denominations of 20 and upwards, a vertical band on the right side of the Mahatma Gandhi’s portrait contains a latent image showing the respective denominational value in numeral which is visible only when the note is held horizontally at eye level.
							<li>
							Microlettering - Numeral denominational value is visible under magnifying glass between security thread and latent image.
							<li>
							Intaglio - On notes with denominations of 10 and upwards, the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, the Reserve Bank seal, guarantee and promise clause, Ashoka Pillar Emblem on the left, RBI Governor's signature are printed in intaglio i.e. in raised prints.
							<li>
							Identification Mark - On the left of the watermark window different shapes are printed in Intaglio for various denominations (20 - Vertical Rectangle, 50 - Square, 100 - Triangle, 500 - Circle, 1000 - Diamond). This also helps the visually impaired to identify the denomination.
							<li>
							Fluorescence - Number panels glow under ultra-violet light.
							<li>
							Optically variable ink - Notes of 500 and 1000 have their numerals printed in optically variable ink. Number appears green when note is held flat but changes to blue when viewed at angle.
							<li>
							See through Register - Floral design printed on the front and the back of the note coincides and perfectly overlap each other when viewed against light.
							<li>
							EURion constellation - A pattern of symbols found on the banknote helps software detect the presence of a banknote in a digital image so that it can prevent its reproduction with devices such as color photocopiers.
