						The Indian government will try to adopt the sign within six months in the country and globally within 18 to 24 months.
\						</p>
						<p>
						The Indian rupee sign is currently used in all leading newspapers and can be seen in any price tag for products. Also various articles in papers where currency is to be used, this new sign is adopted instead of previous sign (Rs). Various new solutions for the usage of the Rupee Symbol have been also developed like WebRupee provides an API which facilitates the usage of the Rupee symbol over the web. Additionally, the Ubuntu operating system is the first computer program to support the Rupee symbol out of the box. The old sign will still be used by other countries that use a Rupee, such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Nepal.
						</p>
						<p>
						Major banks have also started printing cheques with the Indian rupee sign where the traditional "?" sign was used. The Indian Postal Department has also started printing postage stamps with the Indian rupee sign, when it issued the Common Wealth Games commemorative stamps on 3 October 2010. In his budget speech on 28 February 2011 the finance minister Pranab Mukherjee announced that the sign will be incorporated on future coin issues.
